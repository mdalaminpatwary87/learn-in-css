    - animations allow to add visual effects and animations to our website without using JavaScript.
    - create an animation in css use the @keyframes rule to define the animation, and then use the animation property to apply it to an element.
    - here some animation property: 
                                  - animation-name                              (specify the name of the animation that you want to apply to an element which is the name of the @keyframes rule that defines the animation)
                                  - animation-duration                          (specify the length of time it takes for an animation to complete one cycle)
                                  - animation-delay                             (specifies a delay before the animation starts)
                                  - animation-iteration-count
                                                            - positive integer  (the animation will repeat that number of times)
                                                            - infinite          (the animation will repeat indefinitely)
                                  - animation-direction
                                                            - normal            (the animation plays forwards from the beginning to the end (default))
                                                            - reverse           (the animation plays backwards from the end to the beginning)
                                                            - alternate         (the animation plays forwards and then backwards in a repeating cycle)
                                                            - alternate-reverse (the animation plays backwards and then forwards in a repeating cycle)
                                  - animation-timing-function
                                                            - ease              (starts slowly, accelerates in the middle, and then slows down again towards the end.)
                                                            - ease-in           (starts slowly and then accelerates towards the end)
                                                            - ease-out          (starts quickly and then slows down towards the end)
                                                            - ease-in-out       (starts slowly, accelerates in the middle, and then slows down again towards the end)
                                                            - liner             (starts slowly and ends slowly same speed from start to end)

                                  - animation-fill-mode                         (specifies how the element should be styled before and after the animation is played)
                                                            - none              (the default value, where the element will not be affected by the animation before or after it is played)
                                                            - backwards         (the element will adopt the style values of the first keyframe when the animation starts)
                                                            - forwards          (the element will retain the style values of the last keyframe when the animation ends)
                                                            - both              (the element will adopt the style values of the first keyframe when the animation starts, and retain the style values of the last keyframe when the animation ends)

                                  - animation-play-state                        (used to control whether an animation is running or paused. This property is particularly useful when you want to give users the ability to pause or resume an animation)
                                                            - running           (the default value, where the animation is playing normally)
                                                            - paused            (the animation is paused and will remain in its current state until it is resumed)

                                  - shorthand property animation: 
                                                            - animation-name
                                                            - animation-duration
                                                            - animation-timing-function
                                                            - animation-delay
                                                            - animation-iteration-count
                                                            - animation-direction
                                                            - animation-fill-mode
