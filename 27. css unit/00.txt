    Absolute size:
        01. Sets the text to a specified size
        02. Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
        03. Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known. 

    Relative size:
        01. Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
        02. Allows a user to change the text size in browsers
        Note: If you do not specify a font size, the default size for normal text, like paragraphs, is 16px (16px=1em).
