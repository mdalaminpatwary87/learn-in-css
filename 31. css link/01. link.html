<!--
    - css links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.
    - four links states are:
        - a:link    : a normal, unvisited link.
        - a:visited : a link the user has visited.
        - a:active  : a link the moment it is clicked.
        - a:hover   : a link when the user mouses over it.

    - remember that, when setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:
        - a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
        - a:active MUST come after a:hover
