<!--Tip: It is good to know about the !important rule, you might see it in some CSS source code. However, do not use it unless you absolutely have to
    Important About !important => The only way to override an !important rule is to include another !important rule on a declaration with the same (or higher) specificity in the source code - and here the problem starts! This makes the CSS code confusing and the debugging will be hard, especially if you have a large style sheet!
    Here we have created a simple example. It is not very clear, when you look at the CSS source code, which color is considered most important.

<html lang="en">

    <title>CSE !IMPORTANT RULE</title>
    <style>
        /* specificity calculation 1,1,0,0 */
        #myid{
            background-color: blue !important;
        }
        /* specificity calculation 1,0,1,0 */
        .myclass{
            background-color: gray !important;
        }
        /* specificity calculation 1,0,0,0,1*/
